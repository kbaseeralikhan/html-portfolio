<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Khadija and this is my website. I'm a degree student pursuing Computer Science and a beginner in Web Development. I also have a backround in studying Business. I hope to reach the end of this full stack course with flying colours.
</p>
<p>When I finish this course, I plan to work on some projects for family and earn through them. I also plan to make fan-based websites for my portfolio.</p>
<p>When I'm done, I'll update my portfolio with some good stuff and then you can hire me. :] </p>
